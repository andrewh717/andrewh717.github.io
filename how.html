<p class="paddingp">Most electric cars on the market in the United States look exactly like ordinary gasoline-powered cars, but they work in very different ways. The only aesthetic difference you might notice is the lack of a tailpipe, and of course, a gasoline tank in most cases. Once you look underneath the exterior of the car, you will begin to see just how different an electric car is. Usually, a person would expect to find an engine, gasoline tank, and several mechanical pieces under the hood of a car. If you open the hood of an electric car, you will only discover an electric motor and a controller.</p>

<h2>Differences from Gasoline-Powered Cars</h2>

<p class="paddingp">The electric motor is unlike an engine because it doesn’t use oil. Instead, it is powered by electricity which is stored in the battery pack of an electric car. Battery packs in electric cars today typically use Lithium Ion batteries, which are stored either under the car or in its trunk. The battery pack is rechargeable via a cord that can be plugged into a standard electrical outlet. The amount of energy sent to the motor is regulated by the controller, which works based on the accelerator pedal. By using a controller, the electric motor does not burn out.</p>

<h2>Regenerative Braking</h2>
<p class="paddingp">An electric motor’s momentum can be used in a special method of braking in electric cars known as regenerative breaking. When the driver of an electric car with regenerative braking steps on the brake, the battery is recharged slightly. Although the amount of energy gained is very small, regenerative braking can increase a vehicle’s range by as much as 15%. Not all electric cars have this braking mechanism, but it is great to buy one that has it.</p>

<p class="paddingp">Everything else in an electric car is just about the same as any other car. Most electric cars are smaller than standard cars, but this is changing as automakers design larger models to accommodate more passengers while still relying on electricity. The most important difference between electric and gasoline cars is that driving an electric car keeps our air clean by not letting off any exhaust, which damages the ozone layer in our atmosphere. The damage dealt by gasoline-powered cars is one of the largest causes responsible for global warming. </p>
