<p class="paddingp">Electric cars are different from ordinary cars for one major reason: they are moved by electric motors. The accelerator pedal in an electric car controls the amount of energy sent to the motor. All of the energy used to power the motor is stored within rechargeable batteries, which can be recharged with household electricity. An electric car is different from a hybrid car, which is powered by gasoline and uses a battery and motor to improve efficiency. Electric cars are powered solely by electricity. This often causes range anxiety, the fear that a vehicle will not be able to reach its destination. Range anxiety is one of the primary obstacles preventing electric cars from being more widely adopted. Other reasons explaining why electric cars are not commonly used have been their long recharging times and the lack of commitment from automobile producers to make and sell electric cars with the same comforts as gasoline-powered cars. Today, these reasons are losing their supporting evidence because batteries are improving. Energy storage is being increased and the prices of electric cars are growing smaller. The advancements being made in the electric car industry are bringing about a new era in transportation. </p>
