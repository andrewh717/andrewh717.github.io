<p class="paddingp">Electric cars became popular in the 1890s and early 1900s. They offered levels of comfort and ease of operation that gasoline-powered cars of the time could not achieve. Electric batteries were used to power cars as early as 1896, when the Hartford Electric Light Company started an exchangeable battery service for electric trucks. A vehicle owner would purchase the truck from General Electric Company without a battery, and the electricity was bought from Hartford Electric by means of an exchangeable battery. The owner of the truck would pay an adaptable per-mile cost and a monthly service fee for the upkeep and storage of the vehicle. The service lasted from 1910 to 1924 and during that time covered over 6 million miles. Starting in 1917, a comparable service was started in Chicago for owners of Milburn Light Electric cars who were also given the opportunity to buy the car without the batteries.</p>

<p class="paddingp">In 1897, electric cars found their first commercial use in the U.S. as taxis in New York City. The cars were built by the Electric Carriage and Wagon Company of Philadelphia. Other electric cars in the U.S. were built by Thomas Edison, Anthony Electric, Baker Motor Vehicle, Columbia Automobile, Detroit Electric, Fritchle Automobile & Battery, Studebaker Electric, Riker Electric Vehicle, Milburn Wagon, and several others in the early 20th century.</p>

<p class="paddingp">Although electric cars were rather slow in the early 1900s, they were better than gasoline-powered cars in several ways. They didn’t have the shaking, odor, and noise for which gasoline cars were notorious. Electric cars did not require drivers to shift gears, a difficulty in driving gasoline-powered vehicles. Also, electric cars were especially popular amongst women because they did not involve the tough task of a manual start. Once internal combustion engines were made for gasoline cars, electric cars started to lose their dominant place in the transportation industry; however, they were not gone forever.</p>

<h2>The Death of the Electric Car</h2>

<p class="paddingp">An energy crisis emerged in the 1970s when oil production peaked in major industrial nations such as the United States and Germany. This resurrected the interest in electric cars. In September 1990, the California Air Resources Board authorized that 2 percent of all new cars sold by any major automakers in California would be “zero-emission” vehicles by 1998—increasing to 10 percent by 2003. This sent automakers into a frenzy trying to make electric cars to be sold. Some of those electric vehicles were the GM EV1, Honda EV Plus, Nissan Altra EV, Ford Ranger EV, Chrysler TEVan, and Toyota RAV4 EV. These cars were eventually drawn from the market, and the plan failed. Most of these cars were destroyed, and it was the “death of the electric car.”</p>

<h2>Present-Day Electric Cars</h2>

<p class="paddingp">The recent economic recession led to the call for more fuel-efficient vehicles such as hybrid and electric cars. Tesla Motors, a California electric car maker, began developing the Tesla Roadster in 2004. It is a small, zero-emission, electric sports car which was first sent to customers in 2008. Tesla Motors stopped taking orders for the Roadster in August 2011. Today, the two most popular electric cars on the market in the U.S. are the Nissan Leaf and the Chevrolet Volt. Although some argue that the Chevy Volt is not an electric car, it is certainly an electric vehicle because there is no mechanical linkage between its gasoline engine and its wheels. The car is powered by electricity from its battery, but when it runs out of electricity on a single charge, it can still recharge the battery using a gasoline engine which generates electricity. The Nissan Leaf, on the other hand, can only be driven a 100 miles on a single charge before it runs out of electricity. This has brought about range anxiety in drivers wishing to purchase the Nissan Leaf. Chevy Volt drivers are able to go 40 miles on a single charge, but they can go extra 260 miles with a full tank of gas. </p>
